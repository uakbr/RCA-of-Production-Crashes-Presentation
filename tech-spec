# Technical Software Spec for Presenting RCA of Production Crashes to Non-Technical Clients

## Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a software tool that will present the root cause analysis (RCA) of production crashes to non-technical clients in an easy-to-understand format. This software tool will be developed using Python programming language and will use various APIs to fetch, analyze, and present the crash data.

## Functional Requirements

1. The software tool should use APIs to fetch data related to production crashes.
2. The data fetched should be stored in a database for further processing.
3. The software tool should analyze the fetched data to determine the root cause of the crash.
4. The root cause analyzed should be presented in an easy-to-understand format to non-technical clients.
5. The software tool should be able to handle multiple requests from different clients simultaneously.
6. The software tool should be easy to set up and deploy in different environments.


## Technical Requirements

1. The software tool will be developed using Python programming language.
2. The software tool will use Flask web framework to handle requests from clients and present the root cause analysis.
3. The software tool will use SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with the database.
4. The software tool will use various APIs like JIRA, Jenkins, Github, etc. to fetch data related to production crashes.
5. The software tool will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the fetched data and determine the root cause of the crash.
6. The software tool will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript to create an easy-to-understand format for presenting the root cause analysis.


## Architecture 

The software tool will have the following high-level architecture:

1. Client will make a request to Flask server.
2. Flask will handle the request and query the database using SQLAlchemy ORM to fetch relevant data.
3. Flask will use APIs to fetch additional data related to production crashes, if required.
3. The fetched data will be analyzed using NLP techniques.
4. The root cause analysis will be presented to the client in an easy-to-understand format using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
5. The client will receive the response and can interact with it further.

#### Detailed Architecture

1. The software tool will be developed using Python programming language and will use Flask web framework to handle requests from clients and present the root cause analysis.
2. The software tool will use SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with the database and APIs like JIRA, Jenkins, Github, etc. to fetch data related to production crashes.
3. The fetched data will be pre-processed and analyzed using NLP techniques, such as bag of words, cosine similarity, text classification, etc.
4. The root cause analysis will be presented in an easy-to-understand format to the client using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
5. The software tool will be deployed on a cloud server for easy access by clients.


## Deployment and Setup Instructions

#### Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository
`git clone https://github.com/username/repo_name.git`

2. Install the required Python dependencies
`cd repo_name && pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Configure the database details in `.env` file


#### Running the server

1. Run the Flask server using the following command
`python app.py`

2. The server will run at `http://localhost:5000`

3. Visit the above URL in a web browser to access the software tool and receive the root cause analysis.

## Conclusion

The above technical spec provides a comprehensive plan for developing a software tool that will present the root cause analysis of production crashes to non-technical clients. The software tool uses Python programming language, Flask web framework, SQLAlchemy ORM, APIs, NLP techniques, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript to achieve the desired functionality. The deployment and setup instructions provide a clear guide to installing and running the software tool in different environments.
